## Overview
A framework for ranked lists selection and fusion, completely unsupervised.

## How to run

You should install the dependencies specified in the "requirements.txt" file and call it like this:
`python usrf.py dataset_name`

The `dataset_name` can be `flowers`, for example.

This repository contains 6 different feature extractions for the [OxfordFlowers-17](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/index.html) dataset, which can be used for testing.

In the future, we intend to provide a documentation of how to incorporate custom datasets.

## Dependencies

This repository includes a binary file of the [UDLF](https://github.com/UDLF/UDLF/) framework, which is licensed under the GPLv2.

There is also [Octave](https://github.com/UDLF/USRF/), which is an optional dependency in case the user wants to generate some plots for the results.

## Source files explained

[usrf.py]  
The main file in the project and should be used to call an execution.

[config.py]  
Contains all the parameters and dataset configurations (file paths and others).

[stages.py]  
Contains the stages of the framework execution  
    - loading stage  
    - pre-selection stage  
    - selection stage  
    - fusion stage  
    - evaluation stage  

[show_messages.py]  
Print messages shown during the USRAF execution.

[rank_dictionaries.py]  
From dictionaries, get lists with the values ranked according to the scores.

[load_data.py]  
Implements functions to read the data (the ranked lists) from the files into memory.

[parameters_estimation.py]  
Estimation of the parameters if enabled in the config are done by the
functions declared in this file.

[correlation_functions.py]  
Routines to compute the correlation measures (Jaccard, RBO, and others).

[effectiveness_estimation_functions.py]  
Routines to compute the effec. estim. measures (Authority and Reciprocal).

[selection_functions.py]  
Routines that implement the selection score.

[tuples_processing.py]  
Compute available pairs, tuples, intersection of pairs, and others.

[evaluation_functions.py]  
Some functions used in the evaluation stage.

[execute_udlf.py]  
Set the parameters and prepare the executions for the UDL framework.
The executions are processed in parallel (using pools).

[udlf/udlf_calls.py]  
Functions to call the UDL framework.

[octave_calls.py]  
Functions that generate octave scripts and build them.
This is used by the evaluation stage.
